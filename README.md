# Project-Books

This project was made just for myself to track my read books and to add description about their content. I also use it to track my books for the final exams at my school and write all the necessary informatin there.
<br/><br/>
The other functions of this website are To Read List with links to my public library, Czech books rating website and one bookstore, and my own dictionary using public API, which I use when I read English book. Then, there are also statistics of the genres, authors I read.
